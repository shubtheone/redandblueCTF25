After analysing a bit I noticed that at right side there is "Dr. Sandeep K jain" written.<br>

So I went to Google maps and searched for "Dr. Sandeep K jain" and Also the I gave this image to other AI which is used for geogusser and it said that this image is somewhere from bihar. So I wrote Bihar in end to get precision. <br>
