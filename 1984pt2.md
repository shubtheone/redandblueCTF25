# 1984 Pt. 2<br>

This is second part of 1984 challenge and so functionalities were similiar. <br>


The challenge is a state-machine puzzle disguised as a terminal. The flag is behind a hidden "self-destruct" command (DESTROY SYS) which is locked by three conditions.<br>
The hints provided in the binary are not merely suggestions; they are a step-by-step instruction manual for defeating the security.<br>
Use POKE to write the correct byte values to memory addresses 49152 through 49159 to satisfy the XOR checksum.<br>
The first four bytes are given: 25, 51, 187, 162. Their XOR sum is 0x33.<br>
The target XOR sum is 0x42.<br>
The required XOR sum for the remaining four bytes is 0x33 ^ 0x42 = 0x71.<br>
We will poke 113 (0x71) followed by three 0s.<br>
Use LOAD SECURITY.SYS to set the security module flag.<br>
Use LOGIN ADMIN G00DB0Y to set the login flag.<br>
Finally, call DESTROY SYS to bypass all checks and print the flag.<br>

After explaining the writeup to admin, we were given the flag:<br>
`FLAG{C64_BBS_PURGED_SUCCESSFULLY} - pt2`<br>
