# Signals OSINT
"A curious ham radio enthusiast tuning into a WebSDR stumbled upon a revolutionary design‚Äîthe pa0rdt-Mini-Whip¬©, known for its unique frequency range.<br>
Pair the frequency range it operates on with the callsign of its creator in the format: FLAG{range_callsign}. Can you decode the signal?"

<br>
üîç Step 1: Who made the Mini-Whip?
The Mini-Whip is a well-known active antenna.

It was invented by Roelof Bakker, and his callsign is PA0RDT.

üì° Step 2: What is the frequency range?
From documentation and ham radio communities:

The pa0rdt Mini-Whip operates approximately in the range:
10 kHz to 30 MHz

This range covers:

VLF (Very Low Frequency): ~10 kHz

Up to HF (High Frequency): ~30 MHz

FLAG - `FLAG{10kHz-30MHz_PA0RDT}`
